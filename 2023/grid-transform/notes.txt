- Want to investigate how to use WebGL matrices in hex-lines to do camera transforms.
- Create 3D grid of points colour coded to show which octant is which.
- Got grid going, colour setting a little bit complex.
- Got camera transform going. Is really world transform, need to do the reverse to the transform that's happening to the camera.
  - Inverting the translation and orientation should do the trick and seems to.
- Need to try adding movement controls.
  - Mouse left click drag to rotate.
  - Mouse right click drag to pan.
  - Mouse middle click drag to forwards/backwards.
  - TODO.
    - Done.
- It all works as expected.
  - Matrix passing to WebGL is working as expected.
  - Nothing is reversed unexpectedly.
- Rotor concern.
  - Rotors stack by multiplying on the right.
  - Matrices stack by multiplying on the left.
  - Would be nice for them to be consistent...
    - Not sure which one should win.
