- Fixing up colour.
  - Added u32ToF32() and rgbaToU32() conversions.
  - Hopefully reinterpret casting a u32 to f32 on the CPU will allow it to be reinterpret casted back to the original u32 on the GPU.
  - Not working.

- Started WebGL2 implementation of WebGPU hex lines.
- Using https://seemly-meter.glitch.me/main.js as an API guide.
- Turns out GLSL supports arrays and structs, not too bad.
- Rendered triangles with no buffers in WebGL for the first time.
- Yet to hook up any buffers, will need to make sure the vertex attribute pointers can be offset.
- Not doing pixelly rendering this time, the join bar really sticks out of the sides of the hexagon and doesn't look good.
  - Rotated the hexagon to match the direction of the bar, lines up nicely now, at least on one side.
  - Will see what happens when the next hexagon is oriented differently.
  - Maybe should join to the lesser radius.
    - Nah that looks off too.
  - Going to just draw each hex twice.
