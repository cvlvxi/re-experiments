- Checking if 7.1.3.1 is "true" as in comes around to rounds without any other repeats along the way.
- Implemented sequencer with output.
- Looks like yes it is true.
- Next ideas:
  - UI to input place notation and number of bells.
  - Update place notation compile step to "correct" the places.
  - Draw the blue line for all the bells side by side.
