- Ideas/wants:
  - ADTs (sealed classes).
  - @ is unique_ptr.
  - # is ref counted pointer.
  - ~ is weak ptr.
  - & is reference with lifetime checks.
  - $ is GC maybe?
  - Absence of pointer type means inline.
  - Constructors and destructors.
  - Classes.
  - Inheritance.
  - Traits.
  - async/await.
  - Promise.
  - List/Map.
  - Generators.
  - Ranges with | syntax.
  - mut.
  - {u,i,f}{8,16,32,64}.
  - Inspection mode.
  - No exceptions, only crash.
  - ? try operator.
