- What if a star flew through the solar system, what happens to the orbits?
- Implemented simple orbit simulation, not accurate numbers of anything.
- Will need to look up what stable orbit configurations are or just guestimate it with trial and error.
- Looked up the stable orbit speed, it's sqrt(GM/radius).
- Added random planets with random colours and angles and radii.
- Added fading of the canvas rather than clearing to watch the trajectories.
- Replaced black background with white because the fade looks nicer.
- Removed gravity when circles are colliding, to implement collision response with proper momentum transfer.
  - Needs a bunch of geometry math to work it out.
  - Removing the hyperslingshot effect makes the animation last way longer now, looks better.
- Experimented with putting the sun at a different Z.
  - Things got bobby.
- Added Z sorting.
- Added YZ camera angle.
  - Looks more like a solar system now.
- Added a bit of YZ rotation to the planets.
- Randomised the YZ camera angle.
  - Have a chance to get the top down view back.
    - This perspective works a bit better for the trajectory trails.
