- Remembering the structure of an animation.
  - AnimationPack
    - Animation map
    - Root Animation
  - Animation
    - Id
    - Guide layers
    - Visible layers
  - Layer
    - Opacity
    - Transform
    - Keyframes
  - Keyframe
    - Start
    - Duration
    - Group
  - Element
    - Opacity
    - Transform
    - Drawing or instance or group
  - Drawing
    - Line buffer
  - Instance
    - Animation id
  - Group
    - Elements
- Renamed Animation to Sprite and AnimationPack to Animation.
- Wrote and moved all class definitions in one file animation.js.
- Reconsidering using classes, maybe use plain JSON instead to make saving and loading trivial.
  - Won't be able to have lineBuffer instances inline, will need a separate mapping along side, will need extra resource management rather than relying on garbage collection like usual.
    - Can probably just do a clean up sweep on save.
    - Use incrementing numeric IDs.
- Rewriting animation definitions in TypeScript interfaces for JSON compat.
- Thinking about how to represent running sub animations.
- Thinking about how to represent animations on transform rather than the sprite.

# 2024-07-25
- Removed third-party submodule repos as they're unused.
  - This is part of consolidating 2023's experiments to use the same third-party checkouts to improve repo initialisation times on GitHub.

# 2023-12-10
- Continued this a bit.
- Updated to AnimationEditor and AnimationPack.
- Added cursor concept to editor.
  - Selects the current animation, its layer, keyframe and element to edit.
  - Can recurse into another animation like a stack.
  - Probably need a separate cursor for which property of the selected element is being modified.
  - Can you edit the layer name without losing the element selection? Should be able to but requires this secondary cursor probably.
- Controls
  - Considering keyboard controls only for now for simplicity.
  - Makes the UI simpler probably if there's no hit detection needed yet.
  - Maybe keys like A/L/K/E for cycling selection of the animation/layer/keyframe/element properties to edit.
  - Need navigation keys for traversing which ALKE is selected.
    - Left/right to select sibling, up to go to parent, down to go to child.
    - Remember which child was previously selected? Probably.
      - Throw it into a temporary map of serialised cursor state to child index.

# 2023-09-29
- Started writing main.
  - Has editor state and animation data and render loop.

# 2023-09-26
- Split off from draw-hex-lines.
  - Keep draw-hex-lines preserved.
- Editor architecture:
  - Animation editor
    - Animation data
      - Sprite map
      - Audio track
      - Root sprite
    - Root sprite editor
      - Editing state
        - Focus
          - Time
          - Background time
          - Layers selected
          - Keyframes selected
          - Items selected
          - Drawing item
          - Selected tool
          - Tool state
        - Viewport
          - Timeline camera
          - Display camera
      - Nested overlay sprite editor
- Editor state is key to architecture.
  - Might be better as ADT.
  - ADT state space:
    struct EditorState {
      sprite: SpriteId,
      playState: PlayState,
      timelineCamera: CameraState,
      displayCamera: CameraState,
      currentFrame: u32,
      backgroundFrame: Option<u32>,
      selection: SelectionState,
      selectedTool: ToolId,
      nestedEditor: Option<EditorState>,
    }
    struct PlayState {
      playing: bool,
      currentFrame: u32,
      startFrame: Option<u32>,
      endFrame: Option<u32>,
    }
    struct CameraState {
      x: f32,
      y: f32,
      zoom: f32,
    }
    enum SelectionState {
      LayerSelect(Vec<LayerId>),
      MultiKeyframeSelect(Vec<KeyframeId>),
      FrameSelect {
        keyframe: Option<KeyframeId>,
        selectedItems: Vec<ItemId>,
        drawingItem: Option<ItemId>,
      },
    }
