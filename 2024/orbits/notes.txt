- Ideas for next orbit thing:
  - A tree with branch factor 20.
  - Each node is a centre point for its immediate children that orbit together.
  - 20 in orbit is n(n-1)/2 = 20 * 19 / 2 = 190 computations.
  - Each block of children centre their average position on their parent node's position.
  - Can perform orbit computation on GPU, each block of orbits a shader invocation.
  - Have orbit position stored on GPU for computation and rendering using flat tree representation.
  - Probably call it orbit-tree.

- What if a star flew through the solar system, what happens to the orbits?
- Implemented simple orbit simulation, not accurate numbers of anything.
- Will need to look up what stable orbit configurations are or just guestimate it with trial and error.
- Looked up the stable orbit speed, it's sqrt(GM/radius).
- Added random planets with random colours and angles and radii.
- Added fading of the canvas rather than clearing to watch the trajectories.
- Replaced black background with white because the fade looks nicer.
- Removed gravity when circles are colliding, to implement collision response with proper momentum transfer.
  - Needs a bunch of geometry math to work it out.
  - Removing the hyperslingshot effect makes the animation last way longer now, looks better.
- Experimented with putting the sun at a different Z.
  - Things got bobby.
- Added Z sorting.
- Added YZ camera angle.
  - Looks more like a solar system now.
- Added a bit of YZ rotation to the planets.
- Randomised the YZ camera angle.
  - Have a chance to get the top down view back.
    - This perspective works a bit better for the trajectory trails.
- Give the gravitational constant double berries so things run faster but not so fast the circles are far apart enough to draw an unsmooth trajectory line.
- Give the planets a bit more speed to avoid them all falling in, their original speed doesn't account for all the other planets pulling them in.
- Compress the planets further away to get more coupled planets in helix orbits.
- Even more planet speed berries which prolongs the helixes more, though the sun gets flung away more easily now.
- Renamed size to mass, rendered the size proportionally smaller for a given mass.
  - Not using the actual volume -> radius calculation because it's too small.
