- Experimental implementation of algorithm for rendering with transparency and pixelation.
- See hex-lines repo notes for same day.
- Data structures:
  - type Drawing = ImageDrawing | GroupDrawing;
  - class ImageDrawing {
      emoji: string,
      x: number,
      y: number,
      pixelSize: number,
    }
  - class GroupDrawing {
      drawings: Array<Drawing>,
      alpha: number,
    }
- Draw drawing onto canvas with pixelation and transparency rendering.
  - Only ImageDrawing leaf nodes can have pixelation, there's no nesting of pixelation.
  - GroupDrawing has alpha transparency which applies to the final render of its children.
  - Transparency can nest.
  - Pixelation is done by rendering a small image and then blitting it onto the canvas at a larger size using nearest neighbour.
  - Pixelation can be mixed in a render, each image has its own pixelSize.
- Canvases:
  - A merge canvas to hold the rendering of a group to apply transparency on the final result.
  - A pixelation canvas to hold the small renderings of images.
    - Multiple image renders of the same pixelSize can stack on the same pixelation canvas to reduce the number of flushes out to the merge canvas.
- Test page:
  - Half page taken up by fixed size canvas.
  - Other half taken up by textarea with JSON representation of drawing.
    - Changes to the JSON update the canvas rendering live.
