- What if a star flew through the solar system, what happens to the orbits?
- Implemented simple orbit simulation, not accurate numbers of anything.
- Will need to look up what stable orbit configurations are or just guestimate it with trial and error.
- Looked up the stable orbit speed, it's sqrt(GM/radius).
- Added random planets with random colours and angles and radii.
- Added fading of the canvas rather than clearing to watch the trajectories.
