- Updated smooth function based on findings from julia-ship.

- Draw velocity and acceleration vectors.
- Would like acceleration to be less jumpy.

- Testing out a smooth point interpolation algorithm for julia-ship.
- Smoothly interpolate from projection of the previous trajectory to the new trajectory.
- Works great.
- Looks like someone constantly rushing from place to place.
- Managed to remember the smoothing function in one try.
