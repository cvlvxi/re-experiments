- Replaced third-party/hex-lines with 2023 common checkout of hex-lines.
  - This is part of consolidating 2023's experiments to use the same third-party checkouts to improve repo initialisation times on GitHub.
  - No changes needed.

- Want editable objects that can be moved around.
- How to manage the objects?
- Example flow:
  - Create new thing.
  - Draw.
  - Select lines.
  - Modify line size/colour/position.
  - Delete lines.
  - Exit editing.
  - Transform thing.
  - Duplicate thing (linked or deep copy).
  - Reorder layering of thing.
  - Select things.
  - Edit thing.
- UI for selection and editing.
  - Need overlay canvas to draw non-pixelated lines.
  - Start with rectangle around lines.
- Drawing.
  - Should optimise pointer points to omit those running in a straight line with the previous two lines.
  - Will likely need larger angle slack when very close to previous point.
- High level aim:
  - Quickly be able to sketch little drawings, arrange and animate them to convey scenes like a storyboard.
  - Should be able to record manual transforms live into keyframes.
  - Would be nice to have declarative transform interpolations and intermingle them with live recorded keyframing.
- High level code sketch:
  - Canvases.
  - Selected tool with settings.
  - Drawing data.
  - Right click menu state.
  - Input handling.
  - Editing context.

- Draw hex lines on canvas.
- Have options to set size and colour.
  - Maybe just a randomise button to start with.
