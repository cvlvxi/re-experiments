- Make Tetris with Scrabble:
  - Tetris game but pieces have letters in them.
  - Scoring:
    - Line clears don't score anything.
    - Making words scores points using scrabble scoring.
    - Maybe have the score multiplier in the background of the grid.
  - Can words have letters before and after them or do they have to be clean?
    - E.g. does the sequence "jcdogpn" score "dog" or not?
    - Might be very difficult to get clean words while playing Tetris.
    - Would probably need blank squares in pieces to manage the gaps between words.
    - If "jcdogpn" scores "dog" then it would score "do" as well right?
- Calling this one tetris-scrabble to leave room for scrabble-tetris.
  - scrabble-tetris is played on a scrabble board.
  - Each turn you're given a tetris piece you have to fill up with your scrabble letters.
  - The tetris piece is falling down onto the scrabble board at the same time.
  - You have to fill it with letters and pick the place in time before it lands.
- Implemented piece shapes.
- Implemented canvas with grid drawing.
- Implemented piece drawing.
  - Not sure what the standard colours are.
  - Picked closeish colours from memory.
- Implemented picking random piece.
- Piece shapes have hardcoded orientations.
  - Decided to hard code orientations because simpler than computing rotations.
  - Realise now that will need to compute the rotations anyway because the letters will be randomised and need to stay consistent across rotation.
  - Rotation is awkward with the 2x2 square block.
- Added input handling.
  - Simply takes game state and event and updates game state.
- Added periodic piece refreshing for testing.
  - Runs in a separate loop from the main draw loop.
  - Probably won't do this in actual game, instead use timing values in the game state with a single frame based loop.
