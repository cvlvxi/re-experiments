- Recreation of http://four-venom.glitch.me/ in 3D using WebGPU.
- Use the compute stage to parallelise the computation of many many more points than four-venom which is completely CPU driven.
- Be in space with stars in the background.
- Camera rotating around origin.
- Veils:
  - Veils spawning from origin in different directions.
  - Multiple veils.
  - Use the historical path of a smooth 3D walkers to generate veil points in those directions.
  - Additive colouring.
  - Start and end of veils fade to transparent.
  - Not made up of dots like in four-venom, will be triangles.
- Maybe consider volumes as well as veils.
  - Possibly a separate experiment.
- Architecture:
  - WebGPU shaders.
    - Gravity path compute.
    - Veil rendering.
    - Data buffers between pipeline stages.
    - Blending configuration.
  - Veil directions computation.
    - 3D walker path history.
  - Gravity points over time.
    - Orbiting origin.
    - Fading in and out.
  - Camera orientation.
