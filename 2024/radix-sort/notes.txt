- Radix sort
  - Sort each column from LSB to MSB in turn.
    - If you do MSB to LSB it doesn't work.
  - Keep stable sorting.
  - Algorithm:
    - For each column (right to left) partition by value and join partitions in order.
    - Can do with with heavy weight maps and stuff.
    - Or can recycle between two arrays like a swap buffer.
