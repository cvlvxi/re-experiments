- Copied from bomber.
- Intended to rewrite the drawing module to use https://github.com/randfur/hex-lines.
- Used to test out using the library and also hopefully improve the performance significantly (it struggles on mobile).
- Finished implementation.
  - Had to replace CSS string colour with RGBA.
  - Replacing 2D canvas rendering was not hard at all, no major refactoring required.
  - Found antialiasing was really needed to avoid the ground dots from popping in and out constantly, added that as a parameter in the library.
- Playing around with pixelSize.
  - Pixel size 6 looks good after increasing the width of everything in the scene.
  - Pixel size 1 is the best because anything above 1 has flickering in the ground background sadly, would prefer to have 6.
- 10 bombers runs smoothly on phone yay.
- Updated number keys to spawn n^2 bombers.
  - Home computer with 1060 card stuggles on 7^2 bombers.
  - DevTools performance tab points at the sorting taking up the most time along with line transforming taking up a lot as well.
  - If this was using a depth buffer then that would be much less of an issue.
    - A 3D version of hex-lines would be the right solution here.
