- Want to do rotations in 4D space.
  - Want to rotate by a rotor4.
  - Involves many many terms to figure out.
  - Probably still faster to compute by hand but an expander tool is more fun probably.
- Expander tool.
  - Will take a list of let assignments and an expression to expand.
  - End result should be a single multivector.
- Parsing strings.
  - Hardest part probably.
  - How to distinguish scalars from bases?
    - Have scalars lowercase and basis uppercase.
    - Example: (aX + bY + cZ) * (dY  + eY + fZ)
  - Also need conj().
  - Tokeniser.
    - If letters then ( treat as function open.
    - If letters then anything else treat as multiplied letters.
    - Let names must be single lowercase character.
    - Will run out of letters probably, allow numbers after single scalar letter also.
    - Can apply to basis uppercase letters also why not.
