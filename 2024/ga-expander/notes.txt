- Want to do rotations in 4D space.
  - Want to rotate by a rotor4.
  - Involves many many terms to figure out.
  - Probably still faster to compute by hand but an expander tool is more fun probably.

  - Will take a list of variable assignments and an expression to expand.
  - End result should be a single multivector.
- Parsing strings.
  - Hardest part probably.
  - How to distinguish scalars from bases?
    - Have scalars lowercase and bases u
