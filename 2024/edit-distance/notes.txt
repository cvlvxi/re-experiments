- Edit distance dynamic programming algorithm.
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance
  - Comparing two strings and counting how many edits to get from one to the other.
  - Edits being inserting a character, deleting a character or replacing a character.
  - Look at top, top left and left cells.
    - Top and left represent insertion/deletion.
      - An insertion for one string looks like a deletion for the other, people call this indel.
      - Indels are always counted as one edit.
    - Top left represents match/mismatch.
      - If the characters mismatch then count it as an edit.
- Goal:
  - Print out all the possible edit paths that are the minimal edit distance.
