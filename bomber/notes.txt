- Quaternions!
- Added quaternion rotation.
  - Added new relativeRotate() method, rotates the axis vector by the quaternion before rotating the quaternion by the axis vector.
    - Makes it easier to rotate by the object local co-ordinate basis vectors.
  - Polarity:
    - Using q*v*conj(q) form of rotation.
    - This wants rotations to be composed with left side multiplication.
    - Tested rotations about (1, 0, 0) gives y -> z, (0, 1, 0) gives z -> x and (0, 0, 1) gives x -> y.
  - Made the bomber rotate about its local co-ordinate basis vectors to roll and pitch.

- Added bomber class with model.
- Added enumerate() helper function for transforming the model (essentially a vertex shader).
- Added rotation around x axis so camera can look down.
- Line widths seem to glitch out when they get too close to the minZ.
  - Updated perspective width calculation to use midZ post clipping, pre clipping would involve positive and negative z values which can average out close to 0 which explains the glitchy behaviour.
- Things for next time:
  - Quaternion orientation.
  - Bomber position, orientation, speed and turning.
  - Similar for camera.
  - Compute turning to face a target position.
  - Bomber target world location, camera target bomber.
  - Will need ground avoidance turning behaviour too.

- Rendered the ground.
  - Scaled the x/y to be much wider.
  - Amplified the height a bit.
- Added Vec3.setPolar() for easier circular test motions.
- Added Vec3.rotateY().
- Made camera fly in circles looking ahead to where it's going.
- Next to do:
  - Make the camera rotate.
  - Make the camera fly across the ground.
  - Put things on top of the ground height.

- Came up with equation for the ground height:
  float rsin(vec2 p) { return sin(length(p)); }
  void mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )
  {
      vec2 pos = 100.*(fragCoord/iResolution.xy - vec2(0.5, 0.5));
      float t = iTime / 6.;
      pos -= vec2(sin(t), cos(t)) * 100.;
      float col =
          rsin(pos + vec2(100., 200.)) +
          rsin(pos + vec2(300., 300.)) +
          rsin(pos + vec2(-200., 700.))
      ;
      col = (col / 3.) + 0.5;
      fragColor = vec4(col, col, col, 1.0);
  }

- Bomber 3D lines animation.
- Visual components:
  - White lines on black.
  - Invisible hilly ground.
  - Stick trees and random bumps on ground to show its elevation.
  - Camera flying in a direction, meandering around the focus point.
  - White line bomber plane flying in, delivering payload, flying out, maybe twirls.
  - Payload is visible on plane before dropping, 6 trails of colour. Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple.
  - Payload turns into vertical arrow ribbons that disperse randomly as if in the wind when dropped.
  - Explosions of colour on impact with the ground, affected targets become painted with the colour.
  - Camera traverses a persistent area, past hit targets visible when they come into view again after a few minutes.
- Code components:
  - 3D lines.
  - 3D vectors.
  - Drawing.
  - Bomber.
  - Payloads.
  - Ground elevation.
  - Ground objects.
  - Explosions.
  - Camera.
  - Focus path.
  - Director.
