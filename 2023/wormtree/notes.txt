- Moving through 3D wormhole that spawns infront of the camera and has branches spawning off (tree).
- One main hole that the camera sticks to.
- Hole surface interior and outlined by floating 3D coloured shapes.
  - Simple geometric shapes, maybe 2D maybe 3D prisms.
  - Flying into position from nothing and dispersing out behind the camera.
- Engine loop:
  - Loop that calls draw on a list of objects.
  - Objects spawned via async function call and removed when complete.
  - Lightweight version of async-game-engine that doesn't support object removal during its lifetime.
- Initial set up:
  - Got test white line drawing.
  - Co-ordinate system is left handed: x right, y up, z in.
  - Pulled run loop into static Engine class, a 37 line game engine.
