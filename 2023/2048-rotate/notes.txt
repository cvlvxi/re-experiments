- 2048 but you rotate your phone to have pieces merge.
- Using GravitySensor.
- Drawing simple blocks for now.
- Need to work out collision physics.
  - Because small number of blocks just going to iterate over everything.
  - Can probably cheat and sort elements by direction of gravity to process them in order of which ones are going to hit the wall first.
  - Kind of working, simple collision tells blocks to stop but need to work out how to let them slide.
  - Maybe need to iterate over edges and deal with them individually.
