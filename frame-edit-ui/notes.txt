- Split UI up into Model, View and Controller parts.
- Can see that view.js doesn't import write().
- Fleshed out UI more, added colour buttons.
- Added frame rendering to canvas.
- Added frame button functionality.
- Added drawing.
- Added animation playback.
- Very basic animation frame editor works now.

- Started on the UI using rojs.
- Using new element insertion, needed to fix bug where reparenting left behind stale flatTree data.
- Very basic hello world UI created.

- Experimenting with HTML UI architecture.
- Trying out pure stateless UI to build a frame animation editor.
- Spawned from hex-lines.
- Aiming for an AnimationPack editor one day, aiming lower for this experiment.
  - Just a multi frame single animation editor.
- Data structure:
  - List of frames.
- Controls:
  - CRUD?
    - Create frame.
    - Show frame.
    - Play animation.
    - Seek animation.
    - Update frame.
    - Delete frame.
- Just testing UI, not going to do fancy GPU rendering of points for frames, just store canvases.
- Would like to try adding layers to this next, including a sketch layer that can be drawn to during playback.
- Would like to eventually add auto toggle: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56Ui6ljAy3w&t=439s
- UI viewing state has a data structure.
  - struct Model {
      framesPerSecond: u8;
      frames: Array<struct Frame {

      }>;
      player: Option<Player>;
      editor: struct Editor {
        frameIndex: u32;
      };
    }
